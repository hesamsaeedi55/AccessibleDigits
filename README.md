This app is designed to empower visually impaired individuals in inputting and managing numeric data. This solution utilizes intuitive gestures and plays auditory feedback, making it a valuable tool for enhancing accessibility on iOS devices.

# Key Features:

To the top 6, to the left 7, to the down 8, and to the right number 9 inserts.


## 2. Correction Mechanism and Auditory Feedback:

The application asks for confirmation from the user by playing the sound of the number to ensure the inserted number is the demanded number of the user. Consequently, the user must approve or disapprove by tapping on the screen. Afterward, the user hears the sound of their feedback. if it was their demanded numbers, the user tap once to mark the number correctly and if it wasn’t, user must taps 2 time to delete the recent inserted number, assign the “pointer” to the previous item of the array, and insert the number again.

## 4. Visual Representation:

Hence, the app is especially designed for visually impaired-disable users, therefo a readable high-constract text of the chosen number shows when the number inserts by the user.


Future Enhancements:

•	Customizable gesture sensitivity and preferences.
•	Expanded language support for auditory feedback.
•	Integration with iOS accessibility settings for a personalized user experience.
